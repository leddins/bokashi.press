    <h2>What is Bokashi?</h2>
      <p>Bokashi is a method of organic waste fermentation that returns virtually all of the carbon back to the soil. The fermentation takes place in a sealed anaerobic environment and with the help of specialist microbes does not produce C02 or methane.</p>
    <h2>How to compost with bokashi</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Put a handful of inoculant flakes in the bottom of the bucket.</li>
        <li>Add kitchen scraps to the bucket, adding a handful of flakes for every few inches of depth. One gallon of flakes should be enough for one bucket.</li>
        <li>Use the plunger to press the food scraps down and keep out as much air as possible.</li>
        <li>Liquid will drip out and collect in the bottom bucket. If all is going well this should smell a little vinegary. Periodically pour it down the drain or dilute it and spread it on your garden.</li>
        <li>When the bucket is full, seal it with a lid and let it ferment for two weeks.</li>
        <li>After 2 weeks you can add it to regular compost or just put it directly in the ground.</li>
      </ol>
